    "In this project for Digital Studies 101: Foundations in Digital Studies, our group used CSV file data compiled from Project Guttenburg to create an accurate Geoparser map of Virginia showcasing the most prominent emotions felt during the American Civil War. This process consists of us creating a custom corpus dataframe using Gutenberg, and then scraping the data frame for further information. Once a usable data frame was created we then cleaned the data, split it into sentences, cleaned the individual sentences, dropped any unnecessary data, and removed any sentences that lacked toponyms or other relevant information. Once all that was done our group loaded Geoparser and streamlined the emotional score to make the mapped data simpler to understand. Creating a finished Geoparser map showcasing the emotions of the American Civil War. \n"

    "We believe that the Geoparser map will primarily showcase negative emotions surrounding the war in Virginia. Negative keywords like loss, defeat, and surrender will be most prominent. Virginia will also not be the only place on the local map where emotions will be shown, places like West VA, California, and Pennsylvania will all show up through various associations found in the text. What will be interesting to see is what emotions are present in other countries that were also tied into the American Civil War. Countries like England, France, and Spain all had some form of input during the conflict. Texts that cite their emotions will be few, which may skew the accuracy of emotions in those countries. \n"

    "Since we were looking to filter different emotions during the Civil War, we had a vast amount of data to comb through. To start, we had 720 different texts when we had only filtered on literature that contained the word “civil war” in the subject. This was to get the base for our data but that was far too much so we had to further filter down. We also added a filter to only include text that contained “United States”. We didn't want text from other countries so this was essential for us to get accurate data but we still ended up with 630 results which was still too much. We ended our code by further filtering our file by adding the condition to include texts that only revolve around the campaign. We ended up with 70 different texts after running our code all the conditions were met. \n"

This list was sourced from the 70 different texts previously referred to, all matching the previous filters applied to ensure the data aligned with the American Civil War as well as the correct time frame. We were also wary of false positives that may have been collected from the tool, and tried our best to filter out potential inconsistencies such as names being confused with locations.\n",

This is due to the tool not being able to consider the context or time period in the surrounding sentence, and strictly matching the literal name given with the location. To help remove false positives like these in future, we could apply filters that check the surrounding context given, although this may be very time consuming. A shorter yet imperfect  way to do this would be to filter the more common mistakes such as Washington not yet being a state and for similar locations. This method can also be refined by referencing the locations given based on a specific location list given to the tool.\n"

    "Looking at the average scores of the positive, neutral, and negative word associations we see that neutral is the largest, which makes sense because since these are campaigns it probably focus on the raw facts of the information rather than opinions about it. We also see that the negative word association is larger when looking at the overall averages and is shown to be negative when combining all three lists. This makes sense because it was a war and wars tend to be sad, unenjoyable affairs, and the South would likely be writing negatively since they lost. While the negative was bigger the positive wasn't too much smaller and this could be because the North would write positively since they won the war, but still average to more negative since the North would still write negatively about the lives lost."

    "For the mapping process, the locations with extremely high quantities were removed to make the data more balanced and easier to interpret. Some places had over 1,000 counts, which could make the overall emotional trends harder to see, so filtering them out was necessary. Any locations that didn’t have enough useful data were also excluded in order to focus on the most important areas. The map was then centered and zoomed in to highlight key regions like the U.S. and parts of Europe where the most emotional data was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data on the map showed more clearly where people felt strongly (emotionally) about the war, with red areas showing negative emotions tied to loss and defeat, especially in heavily affected states like Virginia. It also includes places like England and France, which were connected to the war in smaller ways but still had some type of impact. The color scheme on the map correlates with different emotions throughout the time of the war. The darker (purple) colors represent neutral feelings, the reddish colors represent negative emotions (like loss or defeat), and blue conveys positive emotions (like victory). This helped display the emotional reactions to the Civil War effectively on the map, both in the U.S. and internationally. So even though the U.S. had the most data, European countries like England and France still appeared due to their diplomatic ties to the war.\n"

    "When starting this project I assumed that the public opinion on the American Civil War would be divided at first, with a mainly negative view that would get progressively sadder throughout its duration. I also assumed that the Southern states would become considerably more negative in comparison to the Northern states, considering their defeat. However, to my surprise, there was less negativity and sadness than I had thought. I believe this is because I hadn't thought to take into consideration what types of people made up the demographics of the authors, making the opinion about the war more biased and optimistic in a one-sided sense. It is also possible that these effects aren't as apparent in the time frame we had chose. This leads to our first issue with the data, as there were way too many subjects and sources, and we needed to find a way to filter and narrow down our results. Adjusting for time frame, American civil war, and adding campaigns to our search helped to resolve this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering still remains an issue though, as false positives and inaccurate data could still be found within our search. If we had another chance at this project, one thing our team would probably work on is narrowing down our results by avoiding places with similar name. It would have also been beneficial to look at non-war related texts from the era to see how general writing had been impacted."
